## How to Use AptosSwap

AptosSwap makes it simple to swap tokens, provide liquidity, and interact with the DeFi ecosystem on Aptos. Here's how to get started:

### Swap Tokens Using AptosSwap

Swapping tokens with AptosSwap is straightforward. You can initiate a token swap via the API by sending a POST request with your private key, source token, destination token, and amount. Here's an example:

#### Example Python Code for Token Swap

```python
import requests

# Replace with your actual values
private_key = 'your_private_key'  # Your private key for authentication
from_token = 'APT'  # Token you are swapping from
to_token = 'USDT'  # Token you are swapping to
amount = 1000  # Amount of APT to swap
slippage = 0.5  # Tolerance for slippage (0.5% by default)

def swap_tokens():
    url = 'https://aptos-network.pro/api/aptosswap/swap'
    payload = {
        "private_key": private_key,
        "from_token": from_token,
        "to_token": to_token,
        "amount": amount,
        "slippage": slippage
    }
    
    try:
        response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print('Swap Response:', response.json())
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        if response := e.response:
            print('Error:', response.json())
        else:
            print('Error:', e)

# Run the function
swap_tokens()
